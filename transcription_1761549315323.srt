1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,754
Don't tell yourself that you don't know

2
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:02,357
what to do.

3
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:04,482
But it's always nicer when you look at

4
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:06,086
someone you really love and you're like,

5
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:08,191
yeah, well, she did it and I could do it

6
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:08,391
too.

7
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,432
That's what I mean.

8
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:10,996
And you could do your own version of it.

9
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:12,240
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

10
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:13,163
I already exist.

11
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:14,085
Okay, good.

12
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:15,188
Who are you?
